                <h2>Static Stretching</h2>
                <p>Static stretching is a form of flexibility exercise that involves holding a position to stretch a particular muscle or group of muscles. It's ideal for improving overall flexibility and range of motion. Static stretches are typically held for 15-30 seconds and should be performed after your workout to help with muscle recovery and reduce the risk of injury.</p>

                <h2>Dynamic Stretching</h2>
                <p>Dynamic stretching involves active movements that mimic the exercises you'll perform during your workout. It helps increase blood flow, heart rate, and joint mobility. Dynamic stretches are perfect for warming up before your main exercise routine. They should be performed in a controlled and deliberate manner to prepare your body for more intense physical activity.</p>

                <p>PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation) stretching is an advanced stretching technique that involves a combination of passive and isometric stretching. It's highly effective in improving flexibility, particularly when performed with a partner. PNF stretching helps to increase muscle strength and flexibility simultaneously, making it a popular choice among athletes and fitness enthusiasts.</p>
